## Highlights (most relevant)
### Thales (Co-op) — Data Protection on Demand (DPOD) | Java / Spring Boot / Kubernetes / GitLab CI
**What I did**
- Replaced a deprecated dependency across **14 Spring Boot services**, unblocking the migration from **Java 11 → Java 17**.
- Ran GitLab CI pipelines, packaged changes, and deployed with Helm to an isolated Kubernetes namespace to validate integration before promotion.
- Executed end-to-end tests across the service set, then fixed integration issues in IntelliJ.
- Raised unit test coverage and cleared SonarQube findings to cut regression risk during the migration.

### Thales (Co-op) — Luna Cloud HSM | Go / Bash / GitLab CI / Python
**What I did**
- Reworked a Go support tool used to diagnose Luna Cloud HSM connectivity and security configuration problems.
- Automated reproducible troubleshooting steps and generated structured terminal output + exportable reports for operators.
- Shipped **7 enhancements** (initial scope: **2**) and demoed the improvements to **55+** engineers and stakeholders.
- Wrote Bash automation to standardize endpoint testing (proxies/env vars/build/run/cleanup).

## Featured projects
### RoomieRanks — Vue + Go + MySQL
Repo: https://github.com/Timber868/roomieranks  
- Built complete user flows (Vue pages wired to Go endpoints, backed by MySQL).
- Implemented Go services with interfaces + composition to keep features modular.
- Designed and iterated the data model (tables, relationships, constraints).
- Debugged using focused SQL checks and endpoint-level tracing.

### McGill Engineering Games — Machine (Robot systems) | C++ / Arduino
Machine 2025: https://github.com/MachineMGCIL/Machine-202wah  
Machine 2026: https://github.com/Timber868/Machine-2026  
- Wrote and tuned control firmware (motors, parameters, Bluetooth communication).
- Built under hard constraints and iterated fast: test → diagnose → adjust → validate.
- Led the Machine team (planning, delivery, and keeping the robot shippable).

### E-Commerce Game Store (ECSE321) — Spring Boot + Vue
Repo: https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2024/project-group-13  
- Owned parts of the frontend (Game View) and contributed to services/controllers.
- Took point on unit testing and kept the codebase stable while features landed.
